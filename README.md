# Aim of the project: Implement the AI techniques to automate verification of produced sensors.
# Characteristics will be verified in order to configure by: Air, Water, Isopropanol

Based on: Dataset of manufactured sensors are collected in the google drive:

# Machine Learning Packages used:
    #Matplotlib - for plotting data in graphs and charts
    #NLTK - natural language toolkit for working with text
    #pandas - the premier data analysis tool for Python
    #scikit-learn - simplifies the implementation of different algorithms
    #Seaborn - for making statistical graphs
    #Numpy - for multi-dimensional array and matrix processing
    #Keras - high-level API that greatly simplifies working with TensorFlow
    #SciPy - for easy handling of mathematical operations
    #PyTorch - simplifies the creation of neural networks using dynamic graphs
    #TensorFlow - simplifies the creation of neural networks using static graphs
    
Graphical way of presenting data,
Filling in data into variables- used LinearRegression
Predicted water and izopropanol results from air dataset on trained model
